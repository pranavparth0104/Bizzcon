      <h5>
          Senior Level Hiring
      </h5>
      <p>
          We understand that the hiring of a senior level management team is extremely crucial for an organization to reach the goal. Hence, we follow some essential steps to minimize the risk of hiring unsuitable candidates for the desired positions:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          We review the company’s strategic planning and review the financial information which is relevant to the hiring process.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          We ask the potential candidates to explain the past work details.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          After completing a few rounds of interview, the candidate is asked to develop his influential ideas to tackle the first six months of his new role.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
            On completion of the hiring process, we allow the candidate to have a one to one discussion with the higher level executives to gather all relevant information regarding the working of the company. On the other hand, the new member understands the company’s expectations for him.
