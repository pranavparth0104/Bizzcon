              What is Recruitment Process Outsourcing?
          </h5>
      <p>
            RPO stands for recruitment process outsourcing. It is a business model where a company outsources the management of the recruitment function (in whole or part) to a third party expert to drive cost, quality, efficiency, service, and scalability benefits. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          The third party RPO vendor is responsible for placing people into that organization. When managed well with a quality provider, RPO can reduce time to hire by 40 percent and deliver cost savings of more than 50 percent.
      </p>
