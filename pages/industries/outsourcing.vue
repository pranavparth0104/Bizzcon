        India is the preferred destination for Outsourcing and Offshoring (O&O) services. O&O capabilities evolved because of advancements in information technology, which led local markets all over the world to converge to become one global marketplace. Owing to these transformations, there have been significant displacements in workforce requirements at all sites.

        However, the once disruptive industry is in the process of getting disrupted by new technologies and other trends including artificial intelligence and expansion drives by erstwhile domestic companies, as they look to establish bases in the same offshore markets from where they had diverted the tasks. This further restructuring of job markets is leading to a major reshuffle in the sourcing of skilled manpower from all across the world, fuelling demand for talented workforce from India domestically as well as globally.
