        Never has there been a more dynamic era in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is now all about technology: autonomous driving, connected vehicle technologies, ride sharing, new mobility services, active safety technologies and hybrid and electric vehicles. As technology continues to disrupt the commercial and consumer automotive markets, businesses need to begin planning—starting with their human capital. In the next few years, many automotive leaders will retire and take their knowledge and experience with them, leaving behind a tremendous leadership vacuum. Few players in the industry have adequate bench strength to fill these critical roles.
