        The FMCG sector in India has become a space for intense competition. The market is highly fragmented with almost 50 per cent share with the unbranded, unpackaged home made products. Well established distribution networks, cheap operating costs, easy availability of raw materials, and the presence across the entire value chain are the factors highly supportive of the FMCG sector in India.

        The FMCG sector continues to face the war for talent, with the number of people with disposable income growing every year. Indian FMCG professionals in the marketing field are considered the best, with many of them leading organisations worldwide. Sales & marketing professionals from FMCG companies have been poached by companies from other sectors and the trend is likely to continue.
