        Globally 840 million people live more than 2 kilometres from all-weather roads, 1 billion people lack electricity, and 4 billion lack Internet access. Achieving the World Bank’s Sustainable Development Goals is only possible if we close these infrastructure gaps. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Technology that can improve the planning, performance, and provision of infrastructure already exists. A myriad of exciting innovations are taking place at all stages of infrastructure development and delivery. Our infrastructure practice lives at the intersection of innovation and talent. We help global infrastructure organizations build smart, comprehensive solutions that stabilize and optimize their workforce and transform organizational performance.

        A well-functioning, modern infrastructure is central to economic development and quality of life. From the roads and railways needed to transport people and goods, to the power plants and communications networks that underpin economic and household activity, to the basic human need for clean water and sanitation—infrastructure matters to people and businesses everywhere. But most countries continue to underinvest in their infrastructure.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Moreover, infrastructure systems remain among the least digitally transformed in the entire global economy. Many modern infrastructure assets have been designed, built, operated and maintained in much the same way for decades, despite enormous strides in innovation across sectors.
