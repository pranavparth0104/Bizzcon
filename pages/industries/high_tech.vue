        High technology and semiconductor companies are the foundation of the technology industry. The right organization and talent is key for growth and success within the industry. Change is happening at an extraordinary pace, both due to technological advancements and unprecedented disruptions. To effectively and quickly handle this change, organizations need to have the muscle and capabilities to meet it head on. Whether addressing a change in talent needs or adjusting working and service delivery models, high-tech and semiconductor companies need to have flexible and forward-looking leadership before even attempting to take on challenges.

        The C-suite needs to continue to drive innovation and growth and build out their team. On top of this, they need to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion, along with upskilling talent and developing the agile leadership needed to drive future growth. Digital transformation is necessary for companies to remain relevant. But this has proved more difficult than anticipated due to not having the right team and skills to drive the transformation. Talent acquisition planning is a race for survival as demand for the right talent far outstrips supplyâ€” and the issue is expected to become more acute over the next decade.
