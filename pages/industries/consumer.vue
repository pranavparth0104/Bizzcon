        Consumer products companies face a variety of challenges today that require them to reimagine how they work and who does that work. Digital technology is accelerating the speed of transactions and the overall nature of the consumer products industry. Meanwhile, intense growth from global competitors means that supply chain optimization and acquisition strategies have come to the forefront. Add to this the need to respond to dramatically shifting customer and workforce preferences and demographics. Consumer products businesses need an agile, diverse workforce, adaptive, cost-effective organizational structure, and innovative talent strategies that align with their corporate imperatives, mission and purpose.
