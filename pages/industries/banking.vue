        The banking industry is reinventing itself. Ongoing digital transformation is leading banks to focus on innovation to prepare for a tech-driven future. With the rise of FinTech and other disruptive technologies, banks have been forced to transition away from traditional ways of doing business. Combine the push for digitalization with intense competition, global economic uncertainty and a restrictive regulatory environment— banks must find new ways to improve operational efficiencies and offer exceptional customer experiences.

        To deliver on the promise of technology and avoid falling victim to the risks inherent in change, banks need a new set of strategies and a new breed of leaders who can execute this transformation. As senior-level talent retires, banks also need to find the next cohort of executives—and ensure they have the skills to connect the dots between the tech and financial services worlds.
