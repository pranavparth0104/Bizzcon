        Life sciences businesses have long been at the tip of the spear when it comes to scientific advances and technological breakthroughs. But these advancements haven’t rendered the industry immune to disruption. Pharma businesses are facing significant pressure on several fronts like: payer and regulatory agencies, an evolving patient-centric model and rising competition from new players around the globe. And the industry as a whole has been affected by the rise of digitization. Blockchain and big data are revolutionizing how clinical trials are run, while AI and machine learning are transforming how businesses make decisions. And finally, as part of a purpose-driven industry with a mission to solve the world’s most pressing healthcare challenges to improve lives, life sciences organizations also have been profoundly affected by recent social movements.
