To support their transformation, they need more digital-ready and multicultural talent — resources that are hard to find in today’s market. They need to identify new recruitment channels, upskill their current workforce and build attractive reward and compensation packages. Then media and entertainment leaders must have the capacity to build and inspire diverse teams with varied skillsets.
