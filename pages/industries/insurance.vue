        The insurance industry is all about managing risk. But insurance companies are grappling with a proliferation of risks on all sides, forcing them to reconsider their business models. Innovation, technology, data, analytics, the internet and mobile continue to disrupt the market. The war for talent and changing customer expectations mean it’s harder than ever for insurers to create strategies to differentiate themselves. Combine these challenges with low interest rates, demographic changes, increased competition and consolidation, and catastrophes. Insurers are turning to digitization, cost optimization, M&A and new ways to work as survival strategies.
