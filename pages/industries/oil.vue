        The Oil and Gas sector in India has been a witness to global fluctuation in the price and volume of petroleum products that saw prices plunging to the lowest from the highest within a decade. The Oil and Gas sector in India is a significant influencer in the major decision-making process for all other sectors in the economy. As the demand for energy keeps rising globally, the demand for skilled manpower to steer the industry keeps rising exponentially.
