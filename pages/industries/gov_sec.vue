        Many of the most fundamental elements that shape our day—including education, utilities, infrastructure, social care, policing, transportation and many other services—are provided by entities (such as government agencies and state-owned enterprises) in the public sector. Most of us rarely stop to think about them unless something goes wrong. But the way that public sector agencies deliver these essential services has transformed in recent years. This is due to increased digital transformation, public-private partnerships and challenges such as: shrinking budgets, rising demands from the population, and threats from cybercrime and social disorder.

        What hasn’t changed? The need for talented people to serve in the public sector. Delivering services to a varied set of stakeholders in disruptive times requires a highly skilled set of leaders and a talented, dedicated workforce. But the war for skilled labor is intense, especially with a talent crunch on the horizon.
