        Technology never stops changing. New devices, new markets and new ways of doing business mean the software market doesn’t stand still. Established contenders in the market are fending off challenges from small, nimbler startups and need new ways to develop and deliver products and reach their market.

        For software and platform companies, the near-constant state of evolution and transition mean traditional leadership skill sets won’t pass muster. Though they may be “born digital,” companies also need to build a customer focused, diverse and agile talent pool that will understand new market opportunities and prepare them to succeed at the next level.
