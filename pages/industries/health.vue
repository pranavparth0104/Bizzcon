        Waves of transformation are rolling through the healthcare industry. Care delivery is evolving as well as how consumers engage with the industry. Healthcare providers are striving to deliver higher-quality care and outcomes while driving efficiencies—requiring integrated delivery systems and new organizational structures and strategies. As the flow of private healthcare capital, venture capital and similar investments surges, competition for high-value exits and other deals is intensifying. Consolidation among payers and providers and deepening public-private partnerships are attracting investment and regulatory attention while global healthcare reform efforts continue across the space.
