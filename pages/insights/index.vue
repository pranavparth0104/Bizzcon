            MAKE YOUR MARKET THE WORLD
      </p>
      <p>
          If you are already successful locally in executive search or leadership consulting and want to go to the next level, we should talk.
            As a member of BCS International Group, your market becomes THE WORLD. Specifically, your colleagues are in across 40 countries. This scale has become the default as our business
            in turn becomes global. You need to be here.
      </p>
      <p>
          But it’s more than just global access. It’s the HOW you access this market.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>
          You Run The Show
      </h5>
      <br>
      <p>
          Most large networks in our sector are corporate-owned or you have to operate under their
name. Great resources, but do it our way. With BCS, you continue to own and control your
operation. You can co-brand, taking advantage of the local reputation you have built and the
Bizzcon name.
      </p>
      <p>
          You don’t compromise anything. Your annual investment is reasonable, you share new and
effective resources, you get to know some great people, and the world is a click away.
